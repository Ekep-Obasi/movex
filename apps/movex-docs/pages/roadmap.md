# Movex Roadmap

#### Current Version: v0.1.6

Movex is already fully functional, supporting real-time multiplayer communication and state synchronization. It’s currently being used in production for web-based multiplayer games (see [Chessroulette](https://chessroulette.live)). Our focus now is to improve performance, expand compatibility, and grow the community of contributors.

### Short-Term Goals (Next 3-6 Months)

**1. Optimize Framework Size**
- Goal: Reduce the overall package size to make Movex lighter and faster to deploy. This will improve performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.
- Benefit: Smaller bundle size makes Movex more accessible to developers who want efficient, low-latency multiplayer games.

**2. Improve Documentation & Tutorials**
- Goal: Add more comprehensive guides, examples, and walkthroughs for new users. Focus on common use cases like integrating Movex with web games.
- Benefit: Lower the barrier for new developers and contributors by offering clear, practical resources.

**3. Multi-Peer Application Use Case Demos**
- Goal: Build demos showing Movex in use for collaborative, multi-peer applications like shared whiteboards or real-time document editing.
- Benefit: Broaden the scope of Movex’s use cases beyond games, showcasing its versatility for real-time collaboration apps.


### Medium-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

**1. Library Integration: Angular, Vue, etc..**
- Goal: Expand Movex compatibility to support popular frontend libraries like Angular and Vue.
- Benefit: Broaden Movex’s adoption by making it available to a wider range of developers who use different tech stacks.

**2. Game Engine Compatibility (Phaser, Babylon.js, etc.)**
- Goal: Integrate Movex with popular JavaScript game engines like Phaser and Babylon.js to create more seamless multiplayer game development experiences.
- Benefit: Make Movex the go-to framework for real-time multiplayer in web-based games.

**3. WebSocket Support**
- Goal: Implement WebSocket support to replace or augment Socket.io. This will enhance real-time communication while reducing overhead.
- Benefit: More efficient communication for multiplayer games, leading to faster performance. Smaller size.

**4. Community Building**
- Goal: Grow an engaged community of contributors and users through Hacktoberfest, Discord discussions, and open feedback.
- Benefit: Increase long-term contributions, feedback, and engagement for the project.


### Long-Term Goals (12+ Months)

**1. io Games Compatibility & Multi-Peer Scaling**
- Goal: Make Movex suitable for massively multiplayer games and large-scale multi-peer applications with features like horizontal scaling, load balancing, and better handling of large user bases.
- Benefit: Scale Movex’s architecture to support both multiplayer games and multi-peer apps with thousands of users.

**2. Advanced State Synchronization Features**
- Goal: Add more robust state synchronization features for edge cases in complex multiplayer games.
- Benefit: Support more advanced use cases in real-time multiplayer games, allowing for smoother, more flexible state management.

**3. Monetization & Sustainability**
- Goal: Explore potential monetization options or sponsorships to ensure the long-term sustainability of Movex as an open-source project.
- Benefit: Secure the future of Movex while keeping the project open and free for developers.
