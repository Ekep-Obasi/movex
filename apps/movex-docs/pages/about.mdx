# About Movex

Movex is an open-source framework designed to simplify multiplayer communication and state synchronization for web games and multi-peer applications. Born from the need to streamline backend logic across projects like Chessroulette, Movex allows developers to seamlessly run game logic on both the client and server without getting bogged down in complex networking protocols. With built-in real-time synchronization and an authoritative server model, Movex is built to handle multiplayer functionality so developers can focus on what they do bestâ€”creating engaging experiences.

Movex is a **[Moves That Matter](https://github.com/movesthatmatter)** project.
