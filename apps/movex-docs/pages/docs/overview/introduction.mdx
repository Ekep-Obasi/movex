Movex is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, inspired by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) but specifically designed for scenarios where state needs to be shared across multiple players or peers in a network. Whether you’re building a turn-based game, a chat application, or anything in between, Movex has you covered.

Best of all, there’s no need to worry about back-end development! Really! You can focus on writing front-end code using any JavaScript framework or game engine, while Movex seamlessly manages the back end for you. [Learn more about how it works here!](/docs/how)
