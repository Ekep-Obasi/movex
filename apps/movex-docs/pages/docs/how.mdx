# How does Movex work

Movex follows the [Flux Pattern](https://redux.js.org/understanding/history-and-design/prior-art#flux) locally to respond to UI changes. It then employs the [Deterministic Propagation Method](/docs/features/functional#determinstic-action-propagation) to synchronize state changes with the Global State(aka Master State) and all peers in the network.

{/* Movex relies heavily on the concept of "Purity" and the "Deterministic Propagation Method", described in more detail [here](/docs/features/functional) to work under the hood. */}


**Understanding and building with Movex involves several key concepts, each playing a vital role:**

1. [Resources](/docs/how/resources)
2. [Reducers](/docs/how/reducers)
3. [Actions](/docs/how/actions)
4. [State](/docs/how/state)
5. [Private State](/docs/how/private_state)
6. [State Synchronization](/docs/how/state_synchronization).
