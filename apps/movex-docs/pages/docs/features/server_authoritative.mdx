# Authoritative Server

**Keeping your app logic secure is crucial**, which is why Movex processes it on a secure server, safe from potential bad actors. The best part? You don’t need to write, maintain, or even worry about this back-end code—Movex handles it all for you.

Under the hood, Movex uses concepts like [Deterministic Action Propagation](/docs/features/functional#determinstic-action-propagation) and runs the [movex.config](/docs/how/movex_config) logic on both the front end and back end to ensure seamless, secure functionality.
