# Serverless

**No back-end code needed. 🥳**

One of the most time-consuming aspects of building multiplayer games or apps with shared states is dealing with the back end. Networking logic, databases, state synchronization, deploying, and maintaining servers—it’s a lot to manage. After going through this process multiple times, I found it became pretty redundant since there’s significant overlap in each project. Worse yet, it took time away from the fun part—actually building the game.

Enter Movex. It removes all that back-end hassle, freeing you, the developer, to focus on what you love most—building your game or app! 😍

And hey, if you do enjoy working on networking and server logic, I could use your help with Movex! Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR on GitHub: [Movex Repository](https://github.com/movesthatmatter/movex).
