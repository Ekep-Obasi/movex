# Realtime State Sync

Movex employs the Observable Pattern under the hood to monitor changes in the Master State (i.e., the Server) across all clients subscribed (i.e. peers) to Movex Resources. This means that as soon as a Resource State is updated, all peers receive immediate notifications, triggering an automatic reprocessing of their local state.
